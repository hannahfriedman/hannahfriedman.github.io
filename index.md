I am a first year PhD student in the Mathematics department at UC Berkeley. I received my B.S. from Harvey Mudd College with High Distinction and Honors in Mathematics. My undergraduate thesis was advised by [Michael Orrison](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/people/faculty/orrison/){:target="_blank"} and is titled [“Long Increasing Subsequences.”](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1274&context=hmc_theses){:target="_blank"}

I am grateful for the support of the UC Berkeley Chancellor’s Fellowship.
