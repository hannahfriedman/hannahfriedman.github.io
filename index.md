I received my B.S. from Harvey Mudd College with High Distinction and Honors in Mathematics.
My undergraduate thesis was advised by [Michael Orrison](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/people/faculty/orrison/){:target="_blank"} and is titled [“Long Increasing Subsequences.”](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1274&context=hmc_theses){:target="_blank"}
My research interests are in algebraic statistics.
