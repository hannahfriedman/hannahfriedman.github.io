I am a first year PhD student in the Mathematics department at UC Berkeley. I received my B.S. from Harvey Mudd College with High Distinction and Honors in Mathematics. My undergraduate thesis was advised by Michael Orrison and is titled “Long Increasing Subsequences.” 

I am grateful for the support of the UC Berkeley Chancellor’s Fellowship.
