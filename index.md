I am a second year PhD candidate in the Mathematics department at UC Berkeley.
I am advised jointly by [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/){:target="_blank"} and [Serkan Hoşten](https://sites.google.com/view/serkanhostensfsu/home?authuser=0){:target="_blank"}.
I received my B.S. from Harvey Mudd College with High Distinction and Honors in Mathematics.
My undergraduate thesis was advised by [Michael Orrison](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/people/faculty/orrison/){:target="_blank"} and is titled [“Long Increasing Subsequences.”](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1274&context=hmc_theses){:target="_blank"}
My research interests are in algebraic statistics, numerical algebraic geometry, and optimization.
My CV can be found [here](resumes/current.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

I am grateful for the support of the UC Berkeley Chancellor’s Fellowship.
