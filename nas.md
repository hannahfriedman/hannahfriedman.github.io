Uniqueness of size-2 positive semidefinite matrix factorizations\\
<span class="header-color">Abstract:</span>
A positive semidefinite (psd) factorization of a nonnegative matrix M expresses the entries of M as the trace inner product between two psd matrices. These factorizations correspond to spectrahedral lifts of a polytope associated with M. We would like to know when these factorizations are unique. In this talk, we will classify when a size-2 psd factorization of a positive matrix of rank 3 and psd rank 2 is unique. The characterization is obtained using tools from rigidity theory. In the first step, we define s-infinitesimally rigid psd factorizations and characterize 1- and 2-infinitesimally rigid size-2 psd factorizations. In the second step, we connect 1- and 2-infinitesimal rigidity of size-2 psd factorizations to uniqueness via global rigidity. We also prove necessary conditions on a positive matrix of rank 3 and psd rank 2 to be on the topological boundary of all nonnegative matrices with the same rank conditions.

Gram Matrices for Isotropic Vectors\\
<span class="header-color">Abstract:</span>
We investigate determinantal varieties
for symmetric matrices that have
zero blocks along the main diagonal.
In theoretical physics,  these arise as Gram matrices for
kinematic variables in quantum field theories.
We study the ideals of relations among
functions in the matrix entries
that serve as building blocks for conformal correlators.

Tropical Fermat-Weber Polytropes\\
<span class="header-color">Abstract:</span>
In this talk we discuss the geometry of tropical Fermat-Weber points in terms of the symmetric tropical metric over the tropical projective torus.  It is well-known that a tropical Fermat-Weber point of a given sample is not unique and we show that the set of all possible Fermat-Weber points forms a polytrope. To prove this, we show that the tropical Fermat-Weber polytrope is a bounded cell of a tropical hyperplane arrangement given by both max- and min-tropical hyperplanes with apices given by the sample. We also define tropical Fermat-Weber gradients and provide a gradient descent algorithm that converges to the Fermat-Weber polytrope.  This is joint work with J. Sabol, D. Barnhill and K. Miura.

The Geometry of Rational Neural Networks \\
<span class="header-color">Abstract:</span>
Rational neural networks are feedforward neural networks with a rational activation function. These networks found their applications in approximating the solutions of PDE, as they are able to learn the poles of meromorphic functions. In this talk, we are going to consider the simplest rational activation function, sigma = 1 / x, and study the geometry of family such architectures. We will show that the closure of all possible shallow (one hidden layer) networks is an algebraic variety, which called a neurovariety.
