\hdr{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}\\
\role{Mathematics Department}{Harvey Mudd College}{Fall 2021}\\
\textit{Investigating relationships between trace ideals and other ideals in commutative rings}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Independently learning background material for research project
  \item Studying the traces of primary ideals in commutative Noetherian rings
    %% Studying the trace ideals of semi-group rings and the traces of ideals whose grade is less than 2
  \item Using algebraic software to generate examples
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\role{Computer Science Department}{Harvey Mudd College}{Summer 2021}\\
\textit{Applied tools from linear algebra to create a new method for performing symbolic execution}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Worked with a research team to generate and optimize an algorithm that utilizes fast matrix multiplication to perform symbolic execution\\
\item Designed and ran tests to compare matrix symbolic execution to traditional symbolic execution
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\role{Mathematics Department}{Harvey Mudd College}{Spring 2020}\\
\textit{Explored the band-limitedness of Discrete Fourier Transforms of permutation statistics}\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Studied permutation statistics as elements of the group algebra $\mathbb{C} S_n$
  \item Created a framework to show why permutations statistics are sparse under the Discrete Fourier Transform
  \item Developed computational tools to verify theoretical results
\end{itemize}
